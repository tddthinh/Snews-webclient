# SnewsProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

This is the front-end for my thesis project as a news and recuitment website. 

Support for checking attendees go in and go out for events by RFID cards.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
